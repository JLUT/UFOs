# UFOs
**Challenge Overview**



In this challenge, we created a webpage to provide the past details of UFO sighting with an option to filter the data based a specific search criteria using Date, City, State, Country and Shape. Also this site will provide duration and specific comments about each occurence. 

On a technology note, we built a table in a webpage using data stored in a JavaScript array. We also created filters to make this table fully dynamic, so it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. 

We customized our webpage using Bootstrap. The advanced filtering capability allows users to filter the data by multiple factors.

**Results**


Once we open up this webpage, we have provided a initial list of all UFO sightings. Users will be able to filter this data based on a combination of data, city, state, country and shape.

**Summary**



Included five total filters in the table:

Date

City

State

Country

Shape


A recommendation for further development would be to filter the other columns. 

Analysis could be done on the Duration of the sightings and/or the Comments for correlation of events. 

Also, more user friendly input fields could be built. Such as, drop boxes.
